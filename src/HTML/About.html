            <div class="inner">
                <p>My name is Emil and I am a software developer student in a course taht focuses on .Net. I'm great at focusing on a single task and making sure it's done before I start with anything else.
                    I always make sure the code is working and looks nice but sometimes I'm pretty awful at remembering to comment in the code. I have done a lot of service jobs and other jobs in my past.
                    During my freetime I like to build and use computers which is why i started studying software development and the pay is a bonus.
